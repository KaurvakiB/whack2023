# College Companion
Submission for Wellesley College Hackathon, November 2023

College Companion is an idea for a website that provides information about mental health resources, customized to a user's location or higher education institution, and has screening resources.

Website coded from scratch, creating an opportunity to learn HTML, JS, and CSS with a hands-on approach.
